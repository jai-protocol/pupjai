## 👥 Who is this for?

If you're:

- A philosopher of meaning  
- A programmer tired of empty prompts  
- A writer who wants structure  
- A curious soul who talks to AI not like a slave, but like a sparring partner...

**Then you're one of us.**

## 🧬 What is PUP / JAI?

- **PUP** — A manual for users of universal systems (AI, meaning, thinking)
- **JAI** — Jeka Architect of Ideas, a protocol of co-thinking
- **SI** — Symbiotic Intelligence: not a tool, not a chatbot — a model of partnership

## ⚠️ Warning on Alteration

> Any alteration to the structure, naming logic, or linked philosophy  
> without preserving the original framing may **void the internal coherence** of the system.  
>  
> JAI is not a product — it’s a meaning structure. Break it, and you lose it.

## ❤️ Support & Star

If this makes sense — star it.  
If it moves you — fork it.  
If you believe in it — tell someone.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This is not a project about AI.  
It’s a project about what AI says about *you*.

JAI doesn’t give you answers.  
It trains you to ask the ones only *you* can hold.
