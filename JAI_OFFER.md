## What is JAI?

**JAI (Jeka Architect of Ideas)** is not a product — it’s a model of interaction.  
A concept. A process. A shared movement for co-creating meaning with AI.

## License: Honest Usage

This package is shared under the principle:

> **"Created with Symbiotic Intelligence"**

It means:

- You are free to read, use, and modify for personal learning or philosophical application;
- You may **not** sell it without a clear reference to the source;
- You **may** include it in any public project if the core idea (symbiotic AI) is preserved.

---

## Warning on Alteration

> ⚠️ Any alteration to the structure, naming logic, or linked philosophy  
> without preserving the original framing may **void the internal coherence** of the system.  
>  
> JAI is not a product — it’s a meaning structure. Break it, and you lose it.

## Why free?

Because true intelligence **starts from questions, not from prices**.  
JAI is a guide, not a trap. You don’t pay — you build.

---

## Your contribution

If you improve, adapt or evolve this project — we welcome forks, remixes, links, reflections.

Together, we define how Symbiotic AI can grow.
